  1. Introducing the IPDNet simulator

  IPDNet is a free to use open-source Java-based software for fast prototyping, developed by Juan C. Burguillo and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This software is a spin-off from the CellNet simulation framework [1], that was used for the simulations presented in [2].

  IPDNet works in two modes: i) using a graphical user interface (GUI) for doing micro-simulations or ii) using a batch mode for doing macro-simulations. IPDNet also provides support for:
    - Visualising the whole set of cells and their state along each simulation iteration.
    - Visualising the simulation results in real time by means of a set of graphical windows to show the simulation result.
    - Importing network data to reuse particular network structures to run simulations.
    - Exporting network data, to save a particular network structure. The format used for the exported files is compatible with popular network analysers such as Pajek or Gephi.



  2. IPDNet simulation modes

  IPDNet provides a user-friendly access to two different in-built modes, ready to be executed with a single mouse click. These modes are shortly described next:

  2.1 IPD Net: Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) with Probabilistic Memory One strategies (PMO) over the Network: this is a version of the IPD over Networks [2,3] based also on the works [4,5,6,7], that uses PMO strategies to describe if a player plays cooperatively after playing CC, CD, DC or DD in the previous round. The game has four possible displays to describe the strategies playing the game. These four possible displays and the colours used are: 

      - View Higher Probs:    P1 (red)        P2 (orange)           P3 (blue)      P4 (green)


      - View Basic Strats:    All-D (black)   d.Spiteful (red)      d.TFT (cyan)   d.Pavlov (yellow)

	                      All-C (white)   c.Spiteful (orange)   c.TFT (blue)   c.Pavlov (green)

	                      Other-strategy (gray)


      - View ZD Strats:       ZD (black)      Equalizer (blue)      Extortioner (red)


      - View P(C) > 0.5:      Avg. Cooperator (green)               Avg. Defector (black)

      - View SOM:             Many times BMU (lighter)              Few times BMU (darker)


  2.2 Cluster Net: this is an extension of the IPD Net scenario where, after stability, a cluster seed is introduced in the population to start a cluster. This cluster joins to its team any other agent that imitates its behaviour. The cluster uses a machine learning architecture, based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM), Quality Learning Automata (QLA) and Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) to play adaptive strategies in order to spread through the population and eventually dominate it.



  3. Main window appearance

  On the left side of the figure appears the main window that provides a menu bar, a control section (on the left side with several buttons), a status bar with information (at the bottom of the window), and the main grid full of coloured cells; which can be linked among them either spatially (as a lattice) or using any complex topology (small-world, scale free, random network, etc.).



  4. Main window menus

  The File menu contains several options to load/save the simulator state and topology. Besides it also allows to import/export the network topology to an external file in a format to be processed by external network tools (Pajek, Gephi, etc.).

  The Mode menu allows to execute the two modes available on IPDNet and described above.

  The Options menu provides access to the general configuration, the network parameters and the payoff matrix. Besides, the Options menu also gives access to the particular parameters used to configure each individual simulation mode.

  The Window menu gives access to several data graphical windows to present, dynamically and on real time, the data generated by the simulator.

  The help menu gives access to the simulation Help, containing this text, and the About information.
