1. Opening IPDNet in Eclipse

The framework has been programmed in Java using Eclipse, and should be easily open as an Eclipse project. Just decompress the IPDNet.zip file to have a IPDNet folder that you must import as a project from Eclipse. You may need to select the Eclipse Preferences and configure TAB to 2 spaces in order to indent the code appropriately.


2. Running IPDNet in standalone version

Just double-click or execute from the shell the IPDNet.jar file provided in the distribution (Note: you must have installed the Java 1.8 version).


3. Documentation

Simply open the “Intro2IPDNet.pdf” file included in the distribution.


4. API

Simply open the “Intro2IPDNet.pdf” file included in the distribution to have a short API description. You can also use the CellNet API also provided with the documentation generated by “javadoc”.
